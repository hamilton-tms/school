# Hamilton TMS Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Completed Deployment Preparations

### Security & Authentication
- ✅ Removed "Register here" button from login page
- ✅ Removed default admin credentials display from login interface
- ✅ Removed registration functionality and routes completely
- ✅ Disabled debug mode (controlled by FLASK_DEBUG environment variable)
- ✅ Changed logging level from DEBUG to INFO for production
- ✅ Added production environment checks for sample data and admin user creation

### Code Quality
- ✅ Clean professional login interface
- ✅ Production-ready error handling
- ✅ CSRF protection enabled
- ✅ Proper session management

## 🔧 Environment Variables for Production

Set these environment variables when deploying:

```
DEPLOYMENT_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=False
DATA_PERSISTENCE_FILE=/persistent/hamilton_tms_data.json
SESSION_SECRET=<your-secure-session-secret>
DATABASE_URL=<your-postgresql-url>
```

## ⚠️ Pre-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Create Production Admin User
Since automatic admin creation is disabled in production, you'll need to create an admin user manually:

1. Deploy the application
2. Access the database directly or create a one-time script
3. Create admin user with secure credentials (NOT admin/password123)

### 2. Data Persistence Location
- Current: `/tmp/hamilton_tms_data.json` (temporary)
- Production: Set `DATA_PERSISTENCE_FILE` to a persistent location
- Recommend: `/persistent/hamilton_tms_data.json` or similar

### 3. Database Setup
- PostgreSQL database is configured and ready
- Environment variable `DATABASE_URL` should be set
- Tables will be created automatically on first run

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

The application is now ready for production deployment with:
- Professional login interface
- Security hardening applied
- Environment-based configuration
- No development artifacts exposed

## 📝 Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Create Admin User**: Set up your production admin account
2. **Test Login**: Verify authentication works
3. **Data Import**: If needed, import production data via CSV upload features
4. **Mobile Testing**: Test multi-device functionality with your team
5. **Backup Strategy**: Set up regular backups of the data persistence file

## 🔍 Known Issues (Non-blocking)

- Select All button has intermittent layout jumping (purely cosmetic)
- LSP diagnostics show type checking issues (runtime functionality unaffected)

All core functionality is working correctly and ready for production use.
